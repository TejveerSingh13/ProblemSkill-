# Notes for TypeScript Concepts

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Its not like it adds more features to existing JS but it a development tool that helps you to write better code. Its all about **Type-Safety**. Only job of TypeScript -> Static Checking.   
Types : number, string, boolean, null, undefined, void, objects, array, tuplees, any, never, unknown, etc. All lowercase.   
Type Inference -> typescript is smart, if you assign a variable a value immediately Eg. `let id = 123`, we dont have to write it as `let id : number = 123`.
